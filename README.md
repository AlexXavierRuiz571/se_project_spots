## Notes

This project is more complex than earlier ones. It reinforces layout structure, responsive behavior, and image handling techniques. A good step forward in building production-ready interfaces.
I am currently learning how to implement JavaScript to add interactivity â€” including modal behavior, form handling, and dynamic card rendering. Future updates will reflect these enhancements as I continue progressing through the curriculum.
