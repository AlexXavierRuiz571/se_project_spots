# Spots

## Overview

**Spots** is a responsive, multi-section photo sharing app built with semantic HTML, BEM-based CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to view a collection of photo cards, like or delete them, and open an image preview modal. This project showcases clean structure, interactive UI elements, and a mobile-first layout.

This project was originally created during the TripleTen Software Engineering Program. It has since been updated with improved modal logic, cleaner DOM handling, and more scalable styling to reflect my growth as a developer.

This project was built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript to reinforce core concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and modular code organization. The structure and setup were supported by AI tools for formatting guidance, but all logic and design decisions reflect my personal understanding and effort.
